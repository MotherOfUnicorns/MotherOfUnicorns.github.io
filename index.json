So read at your own pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the central thesis of the book is that trauma is not only a mental process, but also physical changes in the body - the treatments discussed focus on combining talk therapy with something else:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ebody-based - e.g. yoga, breathing exercises, etc. I\u0026rsquo;ve been personally expermenting with some breathing techniques, and they do have an effect. But I need much more practice to remember using them when I actually need them the most.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etheatre - to play other characters seems to help one confront and process ones\u0026rsquo; own trauma\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInternal Family Systems (IFS) - by treating different parts of the \u0026ldquo;self\u0026rdquo; as different members of a family, each with their own needs and wants, you can address internal conflicts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEye Movement Desnsitisation and Reprecessing (EMDR) - this bit souded a bit too magical to me. Basically by moving your eyes back and forth in some way, it helps the brain to process traumatic stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m curious if this is something I can try out when I\u0026rsquo;m taking a walk by the canals.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eneuralfeedback - this is another magical one. Out of curiousity I searched for practices in my area that offer this as a service, and it turns out there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of them! Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s also a pretty popular brain-hacking activity, with portable devices you can use at your own home. Many of them advertise \u0026ldquo;producitvity gain\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;better focus\u0026rdquo; or whatever modern life aspires to. But I think I\u0026rsquo;m not adventourous enough (yet) to mess with my brain waves. Side note, I do think van der Kolk made a good point about the chemial vs physical processes which the brain relies on for its functions - there\u0026rsquo;s an overwhelming focus on using pharmaceuticals to fix people, but research in using physical properties of the brain (e.g. how the electrical signals move across neurons) is not as popular, at least for a lay person like me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epsychedelics (used under the direction of a professional) - need I say more :).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n"

Not the glorious Motherland Russia that started the revolution, but in Kazakhstan, where religion, traditions, and old legends are perhaps a bit more at odds with the Soviet ideals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a somber story, although at times it feels like an elaborate Soviet joke, with both the story teller and the listener aware of the hopelessness of it all, but still making the most out of the situation.

To prove this, one has only to recall the ‘Cultural Revolution’ in China, which manipulated the consciousness of the people and reduced the many complications of life to the level of quotations from the so-called little Red books of Mao. Here, the ancient traditions of the people clashed with the hegemonic policies of the then Chinese government. Paradoxically this denial or falsification of the past went hand in hand with a self-satisfied, boastful chauvinism. The result was isolation; for only behind a real or metaphorical Wall of China can one preserve the myth of the superiority of one people over all others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is such a sick burn given today\u0026rsquo;s politics. Some thirty years later both the real and metaphorical Wall of China is getting higher and thicker than ever.\nI guess thirty years is still too little time to really learn anything, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not trying very hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

From my limited sample size of talking to and listening to presentations of my fellow students participating in this challenge, it seems like it\u0026rsquo;s quite common to \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003enot\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e be able to reproduce a paper\u0026rsquo;s results completely, not in four weeks at least. That\u0026rsquo;s not as optimistic as I had thought.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a way my group already had a head start, because the paper we tried to reproduce already came with some pretty extensive code, nuts and bolts included.\nBut after scrolling through pages after pages, we realised this code is adapted from another paper, so there are a lot of dangling variables and unfinished experiments hidden inside, and at times this could be really confusing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBeing the overachieving students that we are, in the very beginning of our reproducibility study we were already thinking about the million different ways we could test this model or examine the authors\u0026rsquo; claims under more general settings.\nBut training these babies is slow, so it\u0026rsquo;s quite easy to get discouraged by the progress.\nThen I felt somewhat swamped in discussions that were mostly speculation rather than factually grounded.\nThat coupled with (almost) midnight zoom meetings was definitely not helpful for my sleep quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall the experience was a very rewarding one, and I want to try to summarise what I observed/learned:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDocument your code.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRemove the bits in your code that you don\u0026rsquo;t actually use.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTest your code. Don\u0026rsquo;t write one thing and your code is actually doing another (wildly different thing).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAt my previous job they made sure we read this book: \u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eClean Code\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, or at least get the gist of it. I think that\u0026rsquo;s a pretty good idea, even if you\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;just a data guy/gal/person\u0026rdquo;.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOptimise your code so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take an insane amount of time (1.5 days! on a NVIDIA 1080 Ti) to train a not-grossly-complex model.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRelated to the previous point, make sure you\u0026rsquo;re not fine-tuning parameters that you don\u0026rsquo;t actually want to change, such as embeddings, unless that\u0026rsquo;s your intention.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIf the dataset only has a train/test split, and you would also want a dev split, it\u0026rsquo;s better to shave it off from the test part rather than train part, otherwise you might overfit your model because your train set and dev set is too similar/correlated.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTrain a model and evaluate multiple times with different seeds to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re not just getting lucky with your results.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReport your hyper-parameters.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eReport your complete results (in an appendix or supplementary materials), don\u0026rsquo;t cherry-pick or leave the impression of cherry-picking your results just to support your claim.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s probably not a good idea to use the same metric to evaluate different datasets/tasks. An accuracy improvement from 65% to 67% is not as awe-inspiring as an improvement from 95% to 97%.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDon\u0026rsquo;t speculate before you get your results from the experiments (talking to myself right now :D). It\u0026rsquo;s easier to come up with one plan after you have solid results than to have ten contingency plans before seeing any actual numbers.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI actually think the scientific community would be much happier and we\u0026rsquo;d be making much better progress as a whole if we all publish \u0026ldquo;failed\u0026rdquo; experiments rather than just those shiny ones.\nKnowing what will not work and what not to do is, in my opinion, much more helpful for gaining new insights and coming up with new ideas to experiment with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMaybe we need to start a negative-arXiv to host the dumb, the unglorious and the unprestigious.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

That\u0026rsquo;s bad, I know.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut there are so many excuses that prevents it, \u0026ldquo;oh this is just an exploratory thing\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;Karen and Chad really needs the report/tool soon, no time for test\u0026rdquo;, or whatever else that might get in your way. Plus there\u0026rsquo;s a tendency to just use the million open-source projects out-of-the box, and expect them to do what you think they do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSometimes they don\u0026rsquo;t work they way you had hoped, and you end up digging thought lines and lines of code hoping to find out what went wrong where. And if you\u0026rsquo;re working with particularly large datasets, just the IO along can slow you down very considerably. Or worse yet, you merrily hand over a \u0026ldquo;finished product\u0026rdquo; without even realising the bugs inside \u0026ndash; because no tests told you so! I can personally attest to this, especially those deadline-rushed projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, this time I did it again. I\u0026rsquo;m about a thousand line deep into my autotrader project, when I realised my features are being scaled in inconsistent ways, that I though of \u0026ldquo;hmm, maybe there should be a test for this\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a very simple operation, take all the values of one feature in the training dataset, subtract the mean, and divide by the standard deviation.\nThe default behaviour of \u003ca href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003esklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e takes the population standard deviation, meaning it\u0026rsquo;s normalised by \u003ccode\u003eN\u003c/code\u003e, the sample size, whereas the default behaviour of \u003ca href=\"https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.std.html\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003epandas.DataFrame.std\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e calculates standard deviation with \u003ccode\u003eN-1\u003c/code\u003e, which is what I expected.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI went back and created a toy dataset, and wrote my own test for my functions and modules which scale different types of features. And many more tests for other functions and modules. I spent a whole week catching up with writing tests. During the process I also refactored some of my maybe-a-bit-too-long functions, so that they\u0026rsquo;re easier to test, and also easier to read.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGranted, bugs are ever-elusive, and no amount of testing can ensure you don\u0026rsquo;t ever make mistakes. But I would sleep better at night. (It\u0026rsquo;s also a great feeling to watch your tests pass one by one, and the green dots appear one after another. So satisfying.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust write some tests, it\u0026rsquo;s better late than never.\u003c/p\u003e\n"
