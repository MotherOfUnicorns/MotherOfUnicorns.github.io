      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-body-keeps-the-score-brain-mind-and-body-in-the-healing-of-trauma&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693771-the-body-keeps-the-score&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma&lt;/em&gt; by Bessel van der Kolk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This book appears to be in between a trade book and a pop-science book, which makes it quite accessible imo and also interesting to read further on some of the topics.&#xA;From the reviews I saw beforehand I&amp;rsquo;m aware there are some bits that verged on the woo-woo, but I&amp;rsquo;ll also acknowledge that this is research from at least 10 years ago.&#xA;And it&amp;rsquo;s been more than that much time since I myself sat in a psyc-101 class.&#xA;Some reviews also mention this book doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer a perspective on the socio-economic perspective on how trauma forms and perpecuates, but I actually think it made some pretty good points on that front.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The opening chapters were tough for me - I do agree with some reviews that he showed less sympathy for victims of war (women, children) then those that committed those crimes and suffered later.&#xA;But the veterans are his patients and not the poor women in vietnam - so I guess one&amp;rsquo;s perspective is always limited.&#xA;Some descriptions of the traumatic events in the book did make it hard for me to read.&#xA;I took a pretty long break in between some chapters when they brought up too many bad memories. So read at your own pace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the central thesis of the book is that trauma is not only a mental process, but also physical changes in the body - the treatments discussed focus on combining talk therapy with something else:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;body-based - e.g. yoga, breathing exercises, etc. I&amp;rsquo;ve been personally expermenting with some breathing techniques, and they do have an effect. But I need much more practice to remember using them when I actually need them the most.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;theatre - to play other characters seems to help one confront and process ones&amp;rsquo; own trauma&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Internal Family Systems (IFS) - by treating different parts of the &amp;ldquo;self&amp;rdquo; as different members of a family, each with their own needs and wants, you can address internal conflicts&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eye Movement Desnsitisation and Reprecessing (EMDR) - this bit souded a bit too magical to me. Basically by moving your eyes back and forth in some way, it helps the brain to process traumatic stuff. I&amp;rsquo;m curious if this is something I can try out when I&amp;rsquo;m taking a walk by the canals.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;neuralfeedback - this is another magical one. Out of curiousity I searched for practices in my area that offer this as a service, and it turns out there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of them! Apparently it&amp;rsquo;s also a pretty popular brain-hacking activity, with portable devices you can use at your own home. Many of them advertise &amp;ldquo;producitvity gain&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;better focus&amp;rdquo; or whatever modern life aspires to. But I think I&amp;rsquo;m not adventourous enough (yet) to mess with my brain waves. Side note, I do think van der Kolk made a good point about the chemial vs physical processes which the brain relies on for its functions - there&amp;rsquo;s an overwhelming focus on using pharmaceuticals to fix people, but research in using physical properties of the brain (e.g. how the electrical signals move across neurons) is not as popular, at least for a lay person like me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;psychedelics (used under the direction of a professional) - need I say more :).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>The Day Lasts More than a Hundred Years</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-day-lasts-more-than-a-hundred-years&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/366889.The_Day_Lasts_More_Than_a_Hundred_Years&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Day Lasts More than a Hundred Years&lt;/em&gt; by Chingiz Aitmatov, translated by John French&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I thought this would be a science-fiction story, because I vaguely remember phrases like &amp;ldquo;aliens&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;building rockets around the world&amp;rdquo; when I first saw it in a random booklist.&#xA;But it&amp;rsquo;s actually first of all a story about a man&amp;rsquo;s life in the Soviet Union, and the life and deaths of his friends.&#xA;It happens in the Soviet Union, but this story is not set at the center of it. Not the glorious Motherland Russia that started the revolution, but in Kazakhstan, where religion, traditions, and old legends are perhaps a bit more at odds with the Soviet ideals.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a somber story, although at times it feels like an elaborate Soviet joke, with both the story teller and the listener aware of the hopelessness of it all, but still making the most out of the situation. Life goes on and there must be hope for the future somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is, in my opinion, a much better book than&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/860566.How_the_Steel_Was_Tempered&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How the Steel was Tempered&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;which was a mandatory read for school kids in China (at least back in the days).&#xA;I wish I had the pleasure of reading Aitmatov&amp;rsquo;s story instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This bit interesting commentary came from the book&amp;rsquo;s preface, written by the author himself (this book was published in 1988):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A man without a sense of history, without memory of the past, who is forced to reconsider his place in the world, a man deprived of the historic experience of his own and other peoples, lacks any perspective and can only live for the present, for the day. To prove this, one has only to recall the ‘Cultural Revolution’ in China, which manipulated the consciousness of the people and reduced the many complications of life to the level of quotations from the so-called little Red books of Mao. Here, the ancient traditions of the people clashed with the hegemonic policies of the then Chinese government. Paradoxically this denial or falsification of the past went hand in hand with a self-satisfied, boastful chauvinism. The result was isolation; for only behind a real or metaphorical Wall of China can one preserve the myth of the superiority of one people over all others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is such a sick burn given today&amp;rsquo;s politics. Some thirty years later both the real and metaphorical Wall of China is getting higher and thicker than ever.&#xA;I guess thirty years is still too little time to really learn anything, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re not trying very hard.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Works by Liu Cixin</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never been the biggest fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin&#34;&gt;Liu Cixin&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;even though he&amp;rsquo;s often heralded as &amp;ldquo;the best sci-fi author in China&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;He does (sometimes) demonstrate interesting ideas by combining scientific concepts and imagination,&#xA;but in my opinion that&amp;rsquo;s not quite enough to be a good sci-fi story.&#xA;In particular,&#xA;these two elements in his writings always leave me feeling irritated,&#xA;if not downright angry:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Helpless female characters with a &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; mind (and body)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can accept it if the men are always the hero &amp;mdash;&#xA;that&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon in most fiction, especially from his time.&#xA;But I cannot accept how women are depicted in his stories:&#xA;silly, helpless, and they just don&amp;rsquo;t really do anything apart from waiting and hoping and praying.&#xA;All his female characters seem to come straight from the damsel in distress trope,&#xA;with little thoughts or desires of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247266-to-hold-up-the-sky&#34;&gt;this translated version&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;the hero in a few of the stories have the opposite gender as compared to the original Chinese stories:&#xA;e.g. &lt;em&gt;The Time Migration&lt;/em&gt;.&#xA;I guess the translator is tired of this gender stereotype as well!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Corruption? What corruption!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Liu often set his stories against a backdrop that&amp;rsquo;s somewhat reminiscient of the typical communist China:&#xA;the people are suffering,&#xA;the system is not working,&#xA;and yet there&amp;rsquo;s still rampant corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The heros of this stories recognize this corruption and wants to make a difference,&#xA;but in the end they still go along with the corrupted ways because that&amp;rsquo;s the only way to move forward for the &amp;ldquo;greater good&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;There is some serious mental gymnastics happening:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This is not working, and I want to fix it!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;But that would mean bringing changes to a lot of people!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no way other people can accept changes!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;So I better stick to how things work now!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;ll also be praised by my boss/elder, because accepting the reality shows that I&amp;rsquo;m being mature!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed this in my life under many different circumstances,&#xA;and I&amp;rsquo;m still incapable of this mental gymnastics.&#xA;Guess who&amp;rsquo;s not mature :-/.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was his intention to irritate his readers to make them reflect and confront the reality,&#xA;but I highly doubt that.&#xA;For me it&amp;rsquo;s more likely that this is just him being true to his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Slaughterhouse-Five</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;slaughterhouse-five&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4981.Slaughterhouse_Five&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slaughterhouse-Five&lt;/em&gt; by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I picked up a random book by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,&#xA;expecting a science-fiction type of story,&#xA;but instead got a book about war.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never liked books or movies about war,&#xA;they glorify it by telling stories of heroes and their gallantry,&#xA;whereas the dead sidekicks and other collateral damages barely constitute an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d hate to be such a sidekick,&#xA;and hate it even more if I were such a hero.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;War is so ridiculously pointless and painful,&#xA;and it always happens because somehow people are lead to think that wars can solve problems.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m not a student of history or of the human psyche,&#xA;but it seems to me that at every chance where an in-group/out-group distinction can be made,&#xA;someone will inevitably feel the need to assert the superiority of their own group identity,&#xA;by launching wars of some form.&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s especially sad is most often people never actually try to get to know know the other side, the human beings they are trying to persecute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!--I just hope I can see world peace in my life, oh well.--&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also just realised that I&amp;rsquo;ve read a lot more stories about WW2 from the perspective of Europeans and Americans than stories from Asia-Pacific,&#xA;even though the war there lasted longer and is no less gruesome.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t recall any Chinese book that tries to combine personal experience of the war with some elements of fiction&#xA;(I&amp;rsquo;m sure they exist, but just somehow never crossed my path),&#xA;or any other book that tries to uncover the futility of war.&#xA;Maybe at that point in China wars of different shapes and forms had been going on for too long and desensitised the people living through them.&#xA;Also I think part of the reason is there was never any serious,&#xA;deep-level reconciliation between China and Japan,&#xA;and on the other hand the current government in China is more than happy to exploit this piece of history for their &amp;ldquo;patriotic education&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also never explored Korean or south-east Asian literatures so I know very little about what happened there.&#xA;And I also don&amp;rsquo;t know how Japan as a country feels about that period,&#xA;but maybe these books can shed some light - I&amp;rsquo;ll read them later:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50021008-memoirs-of-a-kamikaze&#34;&gt;Memoirs of a Kamikaze: A World War II Pilot&amp;rsquo;s Inspiring Story of Survival, Honor and Reconciliation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37569315-thirty-minutes-over-oregon&#34;&gt;Thirty Minutes Over Oregon: A Japanese Pilot&amp;rsquo;s World War II Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;ham-on-rye&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38501.Ham_on_Rye&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ham on Rye&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Bukowski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been curious about the writings of Charles Bukowski for a while,&#xA;mostly because of his dirty, subversive style.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This story delivers just that:&#xA;a straight punch to the gut&#xA;(there are many punches thrown in the book, both figurative and literal),&#xA;packed with the hopelessness and disillusionment of being an outsider,&#xA;and the rage of man against machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Among the many themes explored in the story,&#xA;the one that resonated the most with me is how an individual can be totally powerless against the institution and the society at large.&#xA;And the violence always makes me shudder.&#xA;I don&amp;rsquo;t like violence, and wish it gone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
