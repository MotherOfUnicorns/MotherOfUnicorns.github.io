      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;_the-day-lasts-more-than-a-hundred-years_-by-chingiz-aitmatov-translated-by-john-frenchhttpswwwgoodreadscombookshow366889the_day_lasts_more_than_a_hundred_years&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/366889.The_Day_Lasts_More_Than_a_Hundred_Years&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Day Lasts More than a Hundred Years&lt;/em&gt; by Chingiz Aitmatov, translated by John French&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought this would be a science-fiction story, because I vaguely remember phrases like &amp;ldquo;aliens&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;building rockets around the world&amp;rdquo; when I first saw it in a random booklist.
But it&amp;rsquo;s actually first of all a story about a man&amp;rsquo;s life in the Soviet Union, and the life and deaths of his friends.
It happens in the Soviet Union, but this story is not set at the center of it. Not the glorious Motherland Russia that started the revolution, but in Kazakhstan, where religion, traditions, and old legends are perhaps a bit more at odds with the Soviet ideals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a somber story, although at times it feels like an elaborate Soviet joke, with both the story teller and the listener aware of the hopelessness of it all, but still making the most out of the situation. Life goes on and there must be hope for the future somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, in my opinion, a much better book than
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/860566.How_the_Steel_Was_Tempered&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How the Steel was Tempered&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
which was a mandatory read for school kids in China (at least back in the days).
I wish I had the pleasure of reading Aitmatov&amp;rsquo;s story instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This bit interesting commentary came from the book&amp;rsquo;s preface, written by the author himself (this book was published in 1988):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man without a sense of history, without memory of the past, who is forced to reconsider his place in the world, a man deprived of the historic experience of his own and other peoples, lacks any perspective and can only live for the present, for the day. To prove this, one has only to recall the ‘Cultural Revolution’ in China, which manipulated the consciousness of the people and reduced the many complications of life to the level of quotations from the so-called little Red books of Mao. Here, the ancient traditions of the people clashed with the hegemonic policies of the then Chinese government. Paradoxically this denial or falsification of the past went hand in hand with a self-satisfied, boastful chauvinism. The result was isolation; for only behind a real or metaphorical Wall of China can one preserve the myth of the superiority of one people over all others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is such a sick burn given today&amp;rsquo;s politics. Some thirty years later both the real and metaphorical Wall of China is getting higher and thicker than ever.
I guess thirty years is still too little time to really learn anything, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re not trying very hard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Works by Liu Cixin</title>
      <link>https://yunli.nl/reading-notes/2021-04-10-liu_cixin/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 16:45:20 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://yunli.nl/reading-notes/2021-04-10-liu_cixin/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never been the biggest fan of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Cixin&#34;&gt;Liu Cixin&lt;/a&gt;,
even though he&amp;rsquo;s often heralded as &amp;ldquo;the best sci-fi author in China&amp;rdquo;.
He does (sometimes) demonstrate interesting ideas by combining scientific concepts and imagination,
but in my opinion that&amp;rsquo;s not quite enough to be a good sci-fi story.
In particular,
these two elements in his writings always leave me feeling irritated,
if not downright angry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helpless female characters with a &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; mind (and body)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can accept it if the men are always the hero &amp;mdash;
that&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon in most fiction, especially from his time.
But I cannot accept how women are depicted in his stories:
silly, helpless, and they just don&amp;rsquo;t really do anything apart from waiting and hoping and praying.
All his female characters seem to come straight from the damsel in distress trope,
with little thoughts or desires of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49247266-to-hold-up-the-sky&#34;&gt;this translated version&lt;/a&gt;,
the hero in a few of the stories have the opposite gender as compared to the original Chinese stories:
e.g. &lt;em&gt;The Time Migration&lt;/em&gt;.
I guess the translator is tired of this gender stereotype as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corruption? What corruption!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu often set his stories against a backdrop that&amp;rsquo;s somewhat reminiscient of the typical communist China:
the people are suffering,
the system is not working,
and yet there&amp;rsquo;s still rampant corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The heros of this stories recognize this corruption and wants to make a difference,
but in the end they still go along with the corrupted ways because that&amp;rsquo;s the only way to move forward for the &amp;ldquo;greater good&amp;rdquo;.
There is some serious mental gymnastics happening:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is not working, and I want to fix it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;But that would mean bringing changes to a lot of people!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no way other people can accept changes!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;So I better stick to how things work now!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;ll also be praised by my boss/elder, because accepting the reality shows that I&amp;rsquo;m being mature!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed this in my life under many different circumstances,
and I&amp;rsquo;m still incapable of this mental gymnastics.
Guess who&amp;rsquo;s not mature :-/.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it was his intention to irritate his readers to make them reflect and confront the reality,
but I highly doubt that.
For me it&amp;rsquo;s more likely that this is just him being true to his heart.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Slaughterhouse-Five</title>
      <link>https://yunli.nl/reading-notes/2021-03-12-slaughterhouse-five/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:36:27 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://yunli.nl/reading-notes/2021-03-12-slaughterhouse-five/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;_slaughterhouse-five_-by-kurt-vonnegut-jrhttpswwwgoodreadscombookshow4981slaughterhouse_five&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4981.Slaughterhouse_Five&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slaughterhouse-Five&lt;/em&gt; by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up a random book by Kurt Vonnegut Jr.,
expecting a science-fiction type of story,
but instead got a book about war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never liked books or movies about war,
they glorify it by telling stories of heroes and their gallantry,
whereas the dead sidekicks and other collateral damages barely constitute an afterthought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d hate to be such a sidekick,
and hate it even more if I were such a hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War is so ridiculously pointless and painful,
and it always happens because somehow people are lead to think that wars can solve problems.
I&amp;rsquo;m not a student of history or of the human psyche,
but it seems to me that at every chance where an in-group/out-group distinction can be made,
someone will inevitably feel the need to assert the superiority of their own group identity,
by launching wars of some form.
What&amp;rsquo;s especially sad is most often people never actually try to get to know know the other side, the human beings they are trying to persecute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also just realised that I&amp;rsquo;ve read a lot more stories about WW2 from the perspective of Europeans and Americans than stories from Asia-Pacific,
even though the war there lasted longer and is no less gruesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t recall any Chinese book that tries to combine personal experience of the war with some elements of fiction
(I&amp;rsquo;m sure they exist, but just somehow never crossed my path),
or any other book that tries to uncover the futility of war.
Maybe at that point in China wars of different shapes and forms had been going on for too long and desensitised the people living through them.
Also I think part of the reason is there was never any serious,
deep-level reconciliation between China and Japan,
and on the other hand the current government in China is more than happy to exploit this piece of history for their &amp;ldquo;patriotic education&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also never explored Korean or south-east Asian literatures so I know very little about what happened there.
And I also don&amp;rsquo;t know how Japan as a country feels about that period,
but maybe these books can shed some light - I&amp;rsquo;ll read them later:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37569315-thirty-minutes-over-oregon&#34;&gt;Thirty Minutes Over Oregon: A Japanese Pilot&amp;rsquo;s World War II Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Ham on Rye</title>
      <link>https://yunli.nl/reading-notes/2021-02-07-ham_on_rye/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;_ham-on-rye_-by-charles-bukowskihttpswwwgoodreadscombookshow38501ham_on_rye&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38501.Ham_on_Rye&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ham on Rye&lt;/em&gt; by Charles Bukowski&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been curious about the writings of Charles Bukowski for a while,
mostly because of his dirty, subversive style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story delivers just that:
a straight punch to the gut
(there are many punches thrown in the book, both figurative and literal),
packed with the hopelessness and disillusionment of being an outsider,
and the rage of man against machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the many themes explored in the story,
the one that resonated the most with me is how an individual can be totally powerless against the institution and the society at large.
And the violence always makes me shudder.
I don&amp;rsquo;t like violence, and wish it gone.&lt;/p&gt;
