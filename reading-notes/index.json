So read at your own pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince the central thesis of the book is that trauma is not only a mental process, but also physical changes in the body - the treatments discussed focus on combining talk therapy with something else:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ebody-based - e.g. yoga, breathing exercises, etc. I\u0026rsquo;ve been personally expermenting with some breathing techniques, and they do have an effect. But I need much more practice to remember using them when I actually need them the most.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003etheatre - to play other characters seems to help one confront and process ones\u0026rsquo; own trauma\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInternal Family Systems (IFS) - by treating different parts of the \u0026ldquo;self\u0026rdquo; as different members of a family, each with their own needs and wants, you can address internal conflicts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEye Movement Desnsitisation and Reprecessing (EMDR) - this bit souded a bit too magical to me. Basically by moving your eyes back and forth in some way, it helps the brain to process traumatic stuff. I\u0026rsquo;m curious if this is something I can try out when I\u0026rsquo;m taking a walk by the canals.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eneuralfeedback - this is another magical one. Out of curiousity I searched for practices in my area that offer this as a service, and it turns out there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of them! Apparently it\u0026rsquo;s also a pretty popular brain-hacking activity, with portable devices you can use at your own home. Many of them advertise \u0026ldquo;producitvity gain\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;better focus\u0026rdquo; or whatever modern life aspires to. But I think I\u0026rsquo;m not adventourous enough (yet) to mess with my brain waves. Side note, I do think van der Kolk made a good point about the chemial vs physical processes which the brain relies on for its functions - there\u0026rsquo;s an overwhelming focus on using pharmaceuticals to fix people, but research in using physical properties of the brain (e.g. how the electrical signals move across neurons) is not as popular, at least for a lay person like me.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003epsychedelics (used under the direction of a professional) - need I say more :).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n"

Not the glorious Motherland Russia that started the revolution, but in Kazakhstan, where religion, traditions, and old legends are perhaps a bit more at odds with the Soviet ideals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026rsquo;s a somber story, although at times it feels like an elaborate Soviet joke, with both the story teller and the listener aware of the hopelessness of it all, but still making the most out of the situation. Life goes on and there must be hope for the future somewhere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is, in my opinion, a much better book than\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/860566.How_the_Steel_Was_Tempered\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow the Steel was Tempered\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e,\nwhich was a mandatory read for school kids in China (at least back in the days).\nI wish I had the pleasure of reading Aitmatov\u0026rsquo;s story instead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis bit interesting commentary came from the book\u0026rsquo;s preface, written by the author himself (this book was published in 1988):\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA man without a sense of history, without memory of the past, who is forced to reconsider his place in the world, a man deprived of the historic experience of his own and other peoples, lacks any perspective and can only live for the present, for the day. To prove this, one has only to recall the ‘Cultural Revolution’ in China, which manipulated the consciousness of the people and reduced the many complications of life to the level of quotations from the so-called little Red books of Mao. Here, the ancient traditions of the people clashed with the hegemonic policies of the then Chinese government. Paradoxically this denial or falsification of the past went hand in hand with a self-satisfied, boastful chauvinism. The result was isolation; for only behind a real or metaphorical Wall of China can one preserve the myth of the superiority of one people over all others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is such a sick burn given today\u0026rsquo;s politics. Some thirty years later both the real and metaphorical Wall of China is getting higher and thicker than ever.\nI guess thirty years is still too little time to really learn anything, especially if you\u0026rsquo;re not trying very hard.\u003c/p\u003e\n"
